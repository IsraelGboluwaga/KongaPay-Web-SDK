### Generate Access Token (PART 3)

All requests to KongaPay requires an Access Token. To generate an Access Token, KongaPay is to provide the merchant with both Merchant ID and Client Secret.

###### Definition of parameters:
- **merchant_id** - Merchant Id provided by KongaPay. String (Maximum of 15 characters)
- **client_secret** - Client Secret provided by KongaPay. This should be kept securely by the Merchant. String (Maximum of 30 characters)
- **access_code** - Access Code is generated by a GET request to the Auth server. Access code is required to generate Access Token. It expires after 30 seconds. String (Maximum of 128 characters)
- **access_token** - Access Token is required to make any request to KongaPay. It expires after 6 hours. String (Maximum of 128 characters)
- **refresh_token** - Refresh Token can be used to get a new Access Token after the expiration of the Access Token. It expires after 14 days. String (Maximum of 128 characters)

##### OAuth 2.0 Authentication
This follows the standard OAuth 2.0 flow where:

1. Client requests an access code
2. KongaPay returns the access code on success of step 1 request
3. Client uses the access code to request access token
4. KongaPay returns the access token and refresh token on success of step 3 request
5. Client then uses the access token to request resources from the server.

###### Base URL for OAuth: 

**Sandbox Environment** - https://staging-auth.kongapay.com

**Live Environment** - https://auth.kongapay.com

Step I

To request for an access code 

URL: `{{oauth_base_url}}/authorize?response_type=code&client_id={merchant_id}&state=alive`
Request Type: GET

Step II
```
Success Message:
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "code": "{access_code}"
  }
}

Error message:
{
  "error": "invalid_client",
  "error_description": "The client id supplied is invalid"
}
```
Step III

Use access code to request token
```
URL: {{oauth_base_url}}/token
Request Type: POST (application/json)
Parameters: 
grant_type = authorization_code
code = {access_code} (the code returned from Step II)
client_id = {merchant_id}
client_secret = {client_secret}
```

Step IV

Success Message to  Step III 
```
{
"access_token": "{access_token}",
"expires_in": 21600,
"token_type": "Bearer",
"scope": null,
"refresh_token": “{refresh_token}”
}

Error Message
{
  "error": "invalid_grant",
  "error_description": "Authorization code doesn't exist or is invalid for the client"
}
```
Step V-a

Using refresh token to get another get another access token
```
URL: {{oauth_base_url}}/token
Request Type: POST
Receives a form-data post with the following parameters
grant_type = refresh_token
refresh_token = “{refresh_token}” (the refresh token returned from step 2)
client_id = “{merchant_id}”
client_secret = “{client_id}”
```
Step V-b

Server returns another token.
```
{
  "access_token": “{access_token}”,
  "expires_in": 21600,
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "scope": null
}
```
###### NOTE: Token/code expiration
*The access token expires after 6 hours. Once the access token expires, the refresh token can be used to request for another token which will last for another 6 hours. However, refresh token expires after 14 days. Once the refresh token expires, the client needs to request another access code which will kick-start the flow again from the beginning.*

*Access code expires 30 secs after it was requested which means the access code must have been used to request a token within 30 secs.*
